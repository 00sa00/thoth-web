        <h3>What is this?</h3>
        <p>
        I hate reading things on browsers. So I made something to automatically download pages, grab their content, and put it in an epub. But then I wanted to use it on phones, and dealing with the horrors of mobile development was more frightning than web development, so here it is, as a webapp.

        The backend is written in F# with Suave.io, running on mono. Front-end is written in Elm.

        <h3>Usage</h3> 
        <p>
            The title is also the filename. Author isn't neccesary, but it'll be missing in the epub metadata. 
            To add a new page, type the url and press enter. It will appear below the line. You may edit them afterwards.
        </p>
        <p>
        The order of the chapters in the epub will be the same as the order of the urls.

        If you find bugs or complaints, send them to tehflyingjam@gmail.com. I probably won't notice it for several days or respond, but it's there.
